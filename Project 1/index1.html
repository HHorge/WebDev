          <h2>//Born to be an artist</h2>
          <p>
            Born in a small village outside Bologna, <b>Giorgio Silvio</b>,
            always yearned for a more fulfilling existence. Early on he
            discovered his uncanny ability to communicate profound messages
            using only a <b>canvas</b> and <b>svg</b>.
          </p>
          <p>
            From humble beginnings Giorgio has since managed to create a
            visually striking, unique, and bold art and fashion empire spanning
            the globe.
          </p>

          <h2>//CSS-grid</h2>
          <p>
            chose to use CSS-grid for this webpage. This because I found it
            relatively easy to get the hang of and it was simple to structure
            the page the way I pictured it in my head.
          </p>

          <p>
            this page only the canvas, svg, and their respective labels are
            fixed to the grid. The rest is hardcoded on the top and bottom of
            the page. This was the simplest way I found to organize the page.
          </p>

          <h2>//SVG AND HTML</h2>
          <p>
            The SVG and HTML feature the exact same artwork, made using pretty
            much the exact same shapes in JavaScript. Both images feature some
            interactivity. Simply use your mouse to click anywhere on the canvas
            to make the sun bounce around like an old screensaver. Clicking
            anywhere (you might have to click twice) on the SVG will result in
            the sun turning into a moon and vice versa.
          </p>

          <h2>//jQUERY</h2>
          <p>
            On this webpage jQuery serves the purpose of replacing the
            getElementBy function in JavaScript. In addition, it makes for an
            easy way of facilitating all the interactivity on the page.
          </p>

          <h2>//TESTING</h2>
          <p>
            During development I did the primary testing using Chrome as my web
            browser. However I also made sure that everything I did also worked
            in Edge.
